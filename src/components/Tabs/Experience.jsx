        Throughout my career, I have worked on a diverse range of projects that
        have significantly contributed to my skills as a full-stack developer. I
        have experience working with the MERN stack to build scalable,
        responsive web applications. My roles have often involved leading the
        development of key features, integrating APIs, and ensuring optimal
        performance and user experience.

        During my time as an Associate Software Engineer at Jalan Technologies,
        I was responsible for implementing a promotion code application feature
        for a live dog wellness project. This required close collaboration with
        both frontend and backend teams to ensure seamless API integration and a
        smooth user experience.

        <br />
        I also had the opportunity to intern at OyeLabs, where I honed my skills
        in frontend development using React.js and Tailwind CSS. I worked on
        various projects, contributing to the development of customer-centric
        products in the edTech and fashion-tech industries. These experiences
        have enabled me to adopt best coding practices and continuously improve
        my problem-solving skills.
        <br />
        <br />
        My background in computer science, combined with my passion for software
        development and continuous learning, has prepared me to tackle complex
        technical challenges effectively. I am always eager to work on
        innovative projects that allow me to grow professionally and make a
        meaningful impact.
