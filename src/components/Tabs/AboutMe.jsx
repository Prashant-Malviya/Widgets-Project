        Hello! Iâ€™m Prashant, a passionate software engineer and full-stack
        developer with expertise in the MERN stack. I have a strong passion for
        software development and enjoy creating innovative solutions to complex
        problems.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have completed two internships, one in frontend development and the
        other in full-stack development, each lasting three months. I recently
        graduated with a degree in Computer Science in June 2024, achieving a
        CGPA of 8.21.
        <br />
        <br />
        Based in Madhya Pradesh, India, I enjoy developing web applications and
        have a keen interest in AI development tools, which I leverage to
        improve the quality and efficiency of my coding workflow. Additionally,
        I am actively involved in solving problems in data structures and
        algorithms, having tackled over 250 problems on platforms like LeetCode
        and GeeksforGeeks.
